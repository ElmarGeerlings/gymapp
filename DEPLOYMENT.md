   - Copy the generated URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.railway.app`)

2. **Test on Your Phone**

## Step 4: Create a Superuser (Optional)

If you want to access the Django admin:

1. **Open Railway Dashboard**
2. **Go to your app service**
3. **Click "Deployments" tab**

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start

- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Verify your `requirements.txt` is up to date

### Database Issues
- Make sure PostgreSQL service is added and connected
- Check that `DATABASE_URL` is properly set

### Static Files Not Loading
