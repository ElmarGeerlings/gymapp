description: Combined internal codebase + external knowledge research using researcher and perplexity tools
argument-hint: [research topic needing both codebase analysis and external knowledge]
---

$ARGUMENTS

use researcher to understand the current codebase implementation and patterns
then use /perplexity command to research external knowledge that can't be found in the codebase (APIs, endpoints, external libraries, best practices, specifications, etc.)
finally synthesize both findings into actionable implementation guidance

write a todolist of these steps:
  researcher: analyze codebase for [topic]
  perplexity: use /perplexity [topic] to research external knowledge
  synthesize: combine findings into implementation plan

make this todolist, then execute each step! think!
