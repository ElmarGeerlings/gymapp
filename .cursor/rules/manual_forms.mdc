# Rule Name: manual_forms.mdc
# Description: Prefer manually defined forms (e.g., inheriting from `django.forms.Form`) over `django.forms.ModelForm` or other model-based form helpers. Explicitly define all form fields and handle data processing (validation, saving) manually in the view or form methods.
